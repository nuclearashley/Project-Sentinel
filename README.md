    # Combine results for comprehensive analysis
    return merge_analysis_results(rule_based, ai_assessment)
```

### **AI Analysis Output Example**

When you upload a file, you'll see sections like:

**ü§ñ AI Security Analysis:**
```
This PDF exhibits several concerning characteristics typical of potentially 
malicious PDF documents. The presence of /OpenAction combined with JavaScript 
functionality creates an automatic execution risk upon opening...

Key Concerns:
1. JavaScript Implementation with app.launchURL capability
2. Automatic execution triggers (/OpenAction detected)  
3. Network communication potential
4. System interaction capabilities (printing functions)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Factors:**
```
1. Remote Code Execution potential through JavaScript
2. Unauthorized network connections via app.launchURL
3. Automatic execution risk through /OpenAction
4. Possible system information gathering
```

**üí° AI Recommendations:**
```
IMMEDIATE: Open only in sandboxed environment, disable JavaScript
PROCEDURAL: Scan with updated antivirus, monitor network connections
LONG-TERM: Implement PDF security policies, deploy content filtering
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- At least 2GB RAM and 1GB available disk space

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuclearashley/Project-Sentinel.git
cd Project-Sentinel
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

#### Option A: Standard Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option B: If You Encounter Compilation Errors
If you get errors like "metadata-generation-failed" or Cython compilation errors, try:

```bash
# For macOS users - install build tools first
xcode-select --install

# Try installing with pre-compiled wheels only
pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option C: Minimal Installation (Troubleshooting)
If the standard installation fails, use the minimal requirements:

```bash
# Install minimal requirements
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

#### Option D: Manual Installation (Last Resort)
If all else fails, install packages individually:

```bash
# Install core packages first
pip install Flask Flask-CORS requests

# Install document processing
pip install python-docx openpyxl pdfminer.six pefile

# Install machine learning packages (may take longer)
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn
```

### Step 4: Configure AI Integration

#### **ü§ñ Set Up Claude AI (Required for AI Features)**

**Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run the interactive API key setup assistant
python setup_api_key.py
```

**Option B: Manual Setup**
```bash
# For macOS/Linux (zsh/bash):
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For Windows (Command Prompt):
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"

# For Windows (PowerShell):
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "your_api_key_here", "User")
```

**Option C: Quick Start Script**
```bash
# Use the provided startup script (includes API key setup)
chmod +x start_ai_enabled.sh
./start_ai_enabled.sh
```

#### **üîë Getting Your Anthropic API Key**
1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`)

**üí∞ Cost Note**: Academic usage typically costs $2-5/month (~$0.02-0.05 per analysis)

### Step 5: Verify Installation

#### Quick Verification
```bash
# Check if all packages are installed correctly
pip list

# Verify AI configuration
python -c "from config import config; config.print_config_status()"
```

You should see:
```
üîß Configuration Status:
   AI Enabled: ‚úÖ
   Anthropic Key: sk-ant-api...
   VirusTotal: ‚úÖ
   AI Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

#### Comprehensive Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the installation test script
python test_installation.py

# Test AI functionality specifically
python demo_ai_analysis.py
```

This script will test all package imports and AI integration, providing specific guidance if any components fail to load.

## Running the Application

### üöÄ **AI-Enabled Startup**

**Option A: One-Command Startup (Easiest)**
```bash
# Uses built-in API key configuration
./start_ai_enabled.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Startup**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Ensure API key is set (if not done permanently)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # macOS/Linux
# or
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here       # Windows

# Start the Flask server with AI enabled
python main.py
```

### ‚úÖ **Verify AI is Working**

When you start the server, you should see:
```

- Files are automatically deleted after analysis
- No permanent storage of analyzed files
- Safe parsing techniques prevent malicious code execution

### Limitations
- This is an educational tool, not a replacement for enterprise security solutions
- Always consult cybersecurity professionals for critical decisions
- The system provides indicators, not definitive malware identification
- Some sophisticated threats may not be detected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation/Compilation Errors**:
   - **"metadata-generation-failed" or Cython errors**: Common on macOS
     ```bash
     # Solution 1: Install build tools
     xcode-select --install
     
     # Solution 2: Use pre-compiled wheels only
     pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements.txt
     
     # Solution 3: Use minimal requirements
     pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
     
     # Solution 4: Install packages individually
     pip install Flask Flask-CORS requests python-docx openpyxl pdfminer.six pefile numpy scipy scikit-learn
     ```
   
   - **"No module named 'numpy'" during scikit-learn install**:
     ```bash
     # Install numpy first, then scikit-learn
     pip install numpy
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Import Errors**:
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - If packages are missing, try: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`

3. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Change the port in `main.py`: `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002, debug=True)` (or any other available port)

4. **File Upload Fails**:
   - Check file size (must be under 50MB)
   - Verify file format is supported (PDF, EXE, DOCX, XLSX)

5. **Analysis Errors**:
   - Check console output for detailed error messages
   - Ensure file is not corrupted
   - Try with a different file to isolate the issue

6. **macOS-Specific Issues**:
   - **Command line tools not found**: Run `xcode-select --install`
   - **Architecture mismatch**: Use `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
   - **Permission errors**: Ensure you're using a virtual environment

### Debug Mode
The application runs in debug mode by default, providing detailed error messages in the console.
