# Project Sentinel: AI-Driven Malware Detection

**Authors:** Andrew Bentkowski and Ashley Dickens  
**Course:** ICTN6862  
**Implementation:** Complete functional system

## Overview

Project Sentinel is a comprehensive AI-driven malware detection system that analyzes common file formats (PDF, EXE, DOCX, XLSX) for potential security threats. The system combines Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) database lookups with advanced AI-driven pattern analysis to provide immediate, educated assessments of file safety.

## Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Analyzes PDF, EXE, DOCX, and XLSX files
- **Dual Analysis Approach**: 
  - OSINT database lookup for known malicious hashes
  - AI-driven pattern analysis for unknown files
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides detailed confidence ratings (0-100%)
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly drag-and-drop interface
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast processing with detailed technical information
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed rationales and technical features
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for learning and research purposes

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- Modern web interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- Responsive design with professional styling
- Real-time progress indication and results display
- Color-coded threat levels with confidence bars

### Backend
- Flask-based REST API server
- Modular analysis engine with specialized analyzers
- Secure file handling with temporary file processing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Analysis Engine
- **OSINT Checker**: Hash-based lookup against malicious file databases
- **PDF Analyzer**: Examines PDF documents for malicious JavaScript, suspicious objects, and encoding patterns
- **Office Analyzer**: Analyzes DOCX/XLSX files for macros, suspicious APIs, and content patterns
- **PE Analyzer**: Examines Windows executables for suspicious imports, packing, and structural anomalies

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later
- Modern web browser with JavaScript support
- At least 2GB RAM and 1GB available disk space

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuclearashley/Project-Sentinel.git
cd Project-Sentinel
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

#### Option A: Standard Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option B: If You Encounter Compilation Errors
If you get errors like "metadata-generation-failed" or Cython compilation errors, try:

```bash
# For macOS users - install build tools first
xcode-select --install

# Try installing with pre-compiled wheels only
pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option C: Minimal Installation (Troubleshooting)
If the standard installation fails, use the minimal requirements:

```bash
# Install minimal requirements
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

#### Option D: Manual Installation (Last Resort)
If all else fails, install packages individually:

```bash
# Install core packages first
pip install Flask Flask-CORS requests

# Install document processing
pip install python-docx openpyxl pdfminer.six pefile

# Install machine learning packages (may take longer)
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

#### Quick Verification
```bash
# Check if all packages are installed correctly
pip list
```

#### Comprehensive Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the installation test script
python test_installation.py
```

This script will test all package imports and provide specific guidance if any packages fail to load.

## Running the Application

### Start the Server
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Start the Flask server
python main.py
```

### Access the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5001`
3. The Project Sentinel interface should load

## Usage Instructions

### Basic File Analysis
1. **Upload a File**:
   - Drag and drop a file onto the upload area, or
   - Click the upload area to browse and select a file
   - Supported formats: PDF, EXE, DOCX, XLSX
   - Maximum file size: 50MB

2. **Start Analysis**:
   - Click the "üîç Analyze File for Threats" button
   - Wait for the analysis to complete (typically 2-5 seconds)

3. **Review Results**:
   - **Green (Safe)**: File appears to be benign
   - **Yellow (Suspicious)**: File has some suspicious indicators
   - **Red (Malicious)**: File is likely malicious

### Understanding Results

Each analysis provides:
- **Threat Level**: Visual indicator of the risk level
- **Confidence Score**: Percentage indicating certainty of the assessment
- **Hash**: SHA-256 hash of the analyzed file
- **Source**: Whether the result came from OSINT database or AI analysis
- **Rationale**: Detailed explanation of the findings
- **Technical Details**: Expandable section with feature analysis

### API Endpoints

The system also provides REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/analysis/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/analysis/upload` - File upload and analysis
- `GET /api/analysis/stats` - Analysis engine statistics
- `GET /api/analysis/supported-formats` - Supported file formats

- Suspicious object identification
- URL pattern analysis
- Encoding pattern detection
- Object structure analysis

### Office Documents (DOCX/XLSX)
- Macro pattern detection
- Suspicious API call identification
- Content pattern analysis
- XML structure examination
- Base64 encoding detection

### Windows Executables (EXE)

- Suspicious API detection
- Packing/obfuscation detection
- String analysis
- PE structure examination

### OSINT Database
- Hash-based lookup against known malicious files

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Use the provided test files in the repository
2. Upload different file types to verify functionality
3. Test with known safe and suspicious files

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite (if test files are available)
python comprehensive_test.py
```

## Security Considerations

### File Safety
- All uploaded files are processed in isolated temporary storage
- Files are automatically deleted after analysis
- No permanent storage of analyzed files
- Safe parsing techniques prevent malicious code execution

### Limitations
- This is an educational tool, not a replacement for enterprise security solutions
- Always consult cybersecurity professionals for critical decisions
- The system provides indicators, not definitive malware identification
- Some sophisticated threats may not be detected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Installation/Compilation Errors**:
   - **"metadata-generation-failed" or Cython errors**: Common on macOS
     ```bash
     # Solution 1: Install build tools
     xcode-select --install
     
     # Solution 2: Use pre-compiled wheels only
     pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements.txt
     
     # Solution 3: Use minimal requirements
     pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
     
     # Solution 4: Install packages individually
     pip install Flask Flask-CORS requests python-docx openpyxl pdfminer.six pefile numpy scipy scikit-learn
     ```
   
   - **"No module named 'numpy'" during scikit-learn install**:
     ```bash
     # Install numpy first, then scikit-learn
     pip install numpy
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Import Errors**:
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - If packages are missing, try: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`

3. **Port Already in Use**:
   - Change the port in `main.py`: `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002, debug=True)` (or any other available port)

4. **File Upload Fails**:
   - Check file size (must be under 50MB)
   - Verify file format is supported (PDF, EXE, DOCX, XLSX)

5. **Analysis Errors**:
   - Check console output for detailed error messages
   - Ensure file is not corrupted
   - Try with a different file to isolate the issue

6. **macOS-Specific Issues**:
   - **Command line tools not found**: Run `xcode-select --install`
   - **Architecture mismatch**: Use `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
   - **Permission errors**: Ensure you're using a virtual environment

### Debug Mode
The application runs in debug mode by default, providing detailed error messages in the console.
