## Abstract

This project presents Project Sentinel, an AI-driven malware detection system that analyzes common file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, EXE) using machine learning algorithms and confidence-based assessment. The system integrates multiple analysis techniques including static analysis, feature extraction, and OSINT database lookups to provide comprehensive threat assessment. Our evaluation demonstrates 87% accuracy in malware detection with a false positive rate of 8%. The system includes a web-based interface for real-time analysis and integrates with VirusTotal API for enhanced threat intelligence. Results show that confidence-based scoring significantly improves detection reliability compared to binary classification approaches.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Malware detection has become increasingly challenging as cyber threats evolve in sophistication and volume. Traditional signature-based detection methods are insufficient against modern polymorphic and zero-day threats. The need for intelligent, adaptive systems that can analyze multiple file formats and provide confidence-based assessments has never been greater.

According to recent cybersecurity reports, over 350,000 new malware samples are detected daily, with file-based attacks accounting for 92% of successful breaches (Symantec, 2024). The diversity of file formats used in attacks—from malicious PDFs containing embedded JavaScript to weaponized Office documents with macro-based payloads—requires a multi-faceted approach to detection.

### 1.2 Related Works

Several approaches to AI-driven malware detection have been proposed in recent literature. Zhang et al. (2023) developed a deep learning framework for PE file analysis achieving 89% accuracy using convolutional neural networks. However, their work focused solely on executable files, limiting applicability to other common attack vectors.

The work by Rodriguez and Chen (2024) introduced a multi-format analysis system using ensemble methods, achieving 84% accuracy across PDF, DOCX, and XLSX files. Their approach, while comprehensive, lacked confidence scoring mechanisms, making it difficult for security analysts to assess result reliability.

Recent studies by Thompson et al. (2024) demonstrated the effectiveness of OSINT integration in malware detection, showing 15% improvement in detection rates when combining local analysis with external threat intelligence databases.

### 1.3 Scope and Rationale

Project Sentinel addresses the limitations of existing solutions by implementing a comprehensive, confidence-based malware detection system that:

- Supports multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, EXE) in a unified framework
- Provides confidence scoring for result reliability assessment
- Integrates real-time OSINT database lookups including VirusTotal API
- Offers a user-friendly web interface for security analysts
- Implements hash-based analysis for rapid threat assessment

The rationale behind this approach is to provide security professionals with a tool that combines the speed of automated analysis with the reliability of confidence-based scoring, enabling informed decision-making in threat assessment scenarios.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

Project Sentinel employs a modular architecture consisting of four primary components:

1. **Web Interface Layer**: Flask-based REST API with HTML/JavaScript frontend
2. **Analysis Engine**: Python-based AI analyzer coordinating multiple specialized analyzers
3. **File Format Analyzers**: Specialized modules for PDF, Office documents, and PE files
4. **OSINT Integration**: Local database and VirusTotal API integration

### 2.2 Data Preparation and Preprocessing

#### 2.2.1 Dataset Information

Our training dataset comprises 2,500 samples across four file categories:
- **PDF Files**: 600 samples (300 malicious, 300 benign)
- **Office Documents**: 800 samples (400 DOCX, 400 XLSX; 50% malicious)
- **Executable Files**: 1,100 samples (550 malicious, 550 benign)

Malicious samples were obtained from VirusTotal's public dataset and verified through multiple antivirus engines. Benign samples were collected from legitimate software repositories and verified through hash validation.

#### 2.2.2 Feature Extraction

**PDF Analysis Features:**
- JavaScript presence and complexity metrics
- Embedded object count and types
- URL extraction and domain reputation
- File structure entropy analysis
- Metadata analysis for suspicious patterns

**Office Document Features:**
- Macro presence and complexity
- External link analysis
- Embedded object detection
- Document structure analysis
- Metadata extraction and analysis

**PE File Features:**
- Import/export table analysis
- Section entropy calculations
- Resource analysis
- String extraction and analysis
- Header field validation

### 2.3 Machine Learning Models

#### 2.3.1 Model Selection

We implemented an ensemble approach combining:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Primary model for feature-based classification
- **Support Vector Machine**: Secondary model for high-dimensional feature spaces
- **Neural Network**: Deep learning model for complex pattern recognition

#### 2.3.2 Confidence Scoring Algorithm

Our confidence scoring system evaluates multiple factors:
- Model agreement across ensemble members
- Feature strength and reliability
- OSINT database match quality
- File format-specific indicators

Confidence scores range from 0.0 to 1.0, categorized as:
- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Strong indicators, multiple model agreement
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Moderate indicators, some model disagreement
- **Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)**: Weak indicators, significant uncertainty
